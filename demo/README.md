# Discrete Math meets Deep Learning

On Youtube, there is
a [video of me talking about this](https://youtu.be/VDjWbPRaTBk) as
well as [silent but animated version](https://youtu.be/jkOwnpWEHfQ) of
the
slides;
remember that you can use the controls to slow it down or speed it up
to your liking. 

## Python code

You can fiddle with
the
[Python source](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.py) to
play with the code on a stand-alone Python installation or
the
[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb) to
just see what it does or to explore ways to improve it (the latter has
a bit more explanations of the steps). You
can
[interact with it](https://colab.research.google.com/github/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb) online
as well.

## Gnuplot files

Those `plot` and `dat` files are for making plots of the solution quality
of SA and epoch accuracy of DL with [Gnuplot](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/).
